This is a way to understand the chance of events, or the likelihood of a certain event happening. Think of it like a scale of 0 to 1, with 0 being 0% and 1 being 100%.\n\n**What is the formula for probability?\n\nThe formula for probability is:\n\nProbability = (Number of successes / Total number of possible outcomes\n\nThis is the formula for probability. However, this is only the formula for the probability of a single event. This formula is just one of a few formulas. There are others, but this is the most common.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf you have a chance of 0.5, you have a probability of 50%. 0.5 is the chance of something happening. If you have a chance of 0.5, then you have a 50% chance.\n\nIf you have a chance of 0.5, you have a chance of half. 50% is the chance of something happening.
